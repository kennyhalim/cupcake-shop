    <ul>
      <li> Cupcakes were actually originally called “Number Cakes” or “1234 Cakes”
        because it was an easy way to remember portions.</li>
      <li> The record for eating the most cupcakes in the shortest
        time is 29 cupcakes in 30 seconds.</li>
      <li> Cupcakes started gaining popularity in the early 2000’s when NYC shops
